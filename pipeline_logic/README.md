The Data Ingestion and Harmonization work stream developed the latest version of N3C Data Ingestion and Harmonization pipeline in Python/SQL and implemented this on the NIH's instance of the Palantir Foundry platform.   Stepwise N3C extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) pipeline tasks are scripts added and managed using a unified framework within Foundry to ingest and harmonize all incoming COVID-19 Electronic Health Records.
